    <h1>Family Leporidae</h1>

<h2>A brief look at Hares and Rabbits, aka Bunnies</h2>

<p><img src="https://static9.depositphotos.com/1571889/1152/i/450/depositphotos_11525992-stock-photo-cute-rabbit-eating.jpg" width="500" /></p>

<p><em>Leporidae</em>,latin for"those that resemble lepus- the hare" is the family name for rabbits and hares. It contains 
    <br>over 70 species. They have short, furry tails and elongated ears and hind legs  &#40;which make them distinctly cute&#41;.
</p>
    
<p>They are commonly referred to as "rabbit" collectively and with "bunny" being another common name for the family. 
    <br>Many countries all over the world , with the exception of Antarctica and Australia, have indigenous species 
    <br>of Leporidae. Of note, the European rabbit, <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>, has been introduced to most of 
    <br>Oceania and to many other islands, where they unfortunately pose a serious ecological and commercial threat.
    <br>But that's a discussion for another day.
